# or more than $100 and less than $500 or more than $500 to apply the discount

# Function to calculate the sum of items based on price and quantity
def calculate_sum(items, price, quantity):
    # Initialize the total variable assign to zero
    total = 0
    for item, cost, qty in zip(items, price, quantity):
        # Multiply each item's cost with its quantity and add it to the total
        total += cost * qty
    return total

# Function to calculate discount based on total purchase amount
def calculate_discount(total):
    # Checking if total is less than 100
    if total < 100:
        # Apply 15% discount
        discount = total * 0.15
    # Check if total is between 100 and 500
    elif total < 500:
        # Apply 20%
        discount = total * 0.20
    # If it's over 500
